https://jira.blizzard.com/browse/WAR3-26693
RKinports 2020

Primary Issue:
The game was not tested for AI difficulty using any type of standards for Easy, Normal, and Hard.

Goal:
Align all campaigns on difficulty
Make sure Hard is challenging to a seasoned veteran

Editing AI files:
https://wc3modding.info/4238/how-to-make-a-campaign-ai/

Note for Normal:
Handicap removed from all missions

Definitions:

Easy (Story Mode)

Players should require minimal RTS experience
One hand rule
Players should be allowed to make many mistakes and recover
Experiencing the cutscenes, scripted gameplay moments, and plot are the priority
Attack move is expected

Normal

Players should be allowed to make mistakes with minimal punishment
Players should be using their keyboard to build and use unit abilities
Attack move is expected

Hard

Players should be punished for mistakes
Bosses and similar pivotal gameplay moments should be memorable due to how hard they are, while remaining interesting
Players will be expected to use most of the tools at their disposal to complete a mission
Targeting individual units by priority is expected
"Gold Stress" should come into play, meaning the player should feel as though they need to expand at some point rather than relying on a single mine without concern

General:

Anecdotally I've heard that the efforts to reduce "wasted" startup time building bases has been appreciated. We did this numerous times by providing more workers and making sure they are harvesting coming out of cutscenes. We should look into how we can apply this further. 

RoC

Prologue

PR01

Normal

2x Gnoll and 1x Gnoll Poacher replaced with 2x Gnoll Brute and 1x Gnoll Assassian at camp
Hard

+1 Gnoll Overseer at camp
All difficulties

Narrator VO first Gnoll will not play or truncate if you attack before they are finished speaking
Narrator VO for a-moving into the Gnoll camp will not play or truncate if you are already moving in
These resolve an issue where the Narrator would be speaking over you doing the thing he's preparing you for
Gnoll camp exit is blocked until you kill all the Gnolls
Players could run past, skipping the experience and more importantly level 2 and the lesson on Chain Lightning
There is a text Hint if you near the barrier while Gnolls are alive
This is the watershed moment of the map so the difficulty is focused here
